## Consistency is the Name of the Game 🎲

To crack FAANG, it’s not about burning out after a week but showing up daily. So here’s the game:

**Rules:**
1. Commit every day, even if it’s just a line of code.
2. Challenge yourself with new problems, and tick them off as you go.
3. Dare to play “Consistency is the Name of the Game” and see if you can make it to 150 days without missing a beat. Let’s see how long you can go without breaking the chain! 

### TL;DR: If you think you're up for it, let’s play to win. 🏆

## 150-Day Plan Overview 🗓️

Below is the high-level plan we'll follow. Each week brings new topics, challenges, and insights. Let’s keep ticking boxes till they’re all struck through!

### 📅 Phase 1: Data Structures & Algorithms

- **Days 1-30:** Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks/Queues
- **Days 31-60:** Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hashing
- **Days 61-75:** Dynamic Programming & Backtracking

### 📅 Phase 2: System Design

- **Days 76-90:** Basics – Scalability, Load Balancing, and Caching
- **Days 91-110:** Complex Systems – Social Media, E-commerce, Messaging

### 📅 Phase 3: Core CS Fundamentals

- **Days 111-130:** Operating Systems, Networks
- **Days 131-150:** Database Management and Revision

Each phase has built-in time for practice, review, and (of course) some well-deserved breaks to avoid burnout.
